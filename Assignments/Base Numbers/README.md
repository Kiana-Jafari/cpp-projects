# Base Numbers Calculator

### 1. Project Scope
This project is an introduction to Base Numbers, a main topic covered in *Digital Logic Design (DLD)* and the fundamentals of *How Computers Work*. </br>
The aim of this project is to design and implement a base numbers calculator from scratch that is able to calculate the following based on the user input:

- Get a number in decimal and convert it to any base, including:
    - Binary
    - Quinary
    - Octal
    - Hexadecimal
    - Other non-popular bases

- Get a number in any base and convert it to decimal

- Get two numbers in any base and do Bitwise Operations on them (AND, OR XOR)

- Get a decimal number and return its `1's complement`

- Calculate and return the `2's complement` of a given number

- Get a plaintext and return the ciphertext, encrypted information
    The main approach for this method is as follows: </br>
    Text → ASCII → Binary → Base-7 → Shift digits → Output
